## Installation & Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

## Input Notation

- `s` or no prefix = Single (e.g., `s20` or `20` = Single 20)
- `d` = Double (e.g., `d20` = Double 20)
- `t` = Triple (e.g., `t20` = Triple 20)
- `db` = Double Bull (50 points)
- `ob` = Outer Bull (25 points)

### Examples
- `t20s20d20` = Triple 20 + Single 20 + Double 20 = 120
- `s19t20d20` = Single 19 + Triple 20 + Double 20 = 99
- `t18db` = Triple 18 + Double Bull = 104

## Game Modes

### FREE Mode (Default)
No time limit - practice at your own pace with unlimited retries.

### Timed Modes
Challenge yourself with time pressure! Score points for correct answers, but game over on any mistake or timeout.
