# üéØ Darts Checkout Practice

A terminal-based program to help you practice darts checkouts. The program presents random checkout scores and validates your dart combinations, ensuring they follow proper darts rules (must finish on a double).

## Features

- **Random Checkout Generation**: Generates valid checkout scores between 2-170 (excludes impossible checkouts like 169, 168, 166, 165, 163, 162, 159)
- **Bullseye Support**: Full support for both outer bull (25) and double bull (50)
- **Input Validation**: Ensures checkouts end with a double and dart combinations are valid
- **Clear Feedback**: Shows whether your attempt is correct or incorrect with helpful error messages
- **Continuous Practice**: Automatically generates new checkouts after successful attempts

## Installation & Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

## Input Notation

- `s` or no prefix = Single (e.g., `s20` or `20` = Single 20)
- `d` = Double (e.g., `d20` = Double 20)
- `t` = Triple (e.g., `t20` = Triple 20)
- `db` = Double Bull (50 points)
- `ob` = Outer Bull (25 points)

### Examples
- `t20s20d20` = Triple 20 + Single 20 + Double 20 = 120
- `s19t20d20` = Single 19 + Triple 20 + Double 20 = 99
- `t18db` = Triple 18 + Double Bull = 104

## Example Gameplay

- Invalid dart scores or combinations
- Checkouts that don't end with a double
- Incorrect total scores
- Too many darts (more than 3)
- Invalid notation
